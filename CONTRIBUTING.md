Welcome to the **LocoBuddy Contribution Guide**, which aims to give you all the information you need to contribute to LocoBuddy. Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

## Bugs, feature requests and support

### I found a bug, how do I report it?

If you find a bug, such as an issue in parsing glossaries, please file a detailed Github Issue containing all of the information necessary to reproduce the bug. This helps us to quickly understand the bug and triage it.

### I have an idea for a feature request

Awesome! You can either create a Github Issue describing your idea and how it would improve the project, or create a Pull Request with your feature. Creating a Pull Request contributes to the project and makes it more likely your idea will be added!

### I have a question

Please make sure you read the documentation (inline in the source files) and [README](README.md) carefully. If your question is still not answered, file a Github Issue detailing your question and what steps you took already.

## Project structure

LocoBuddy is structured in the default way for Swift Packages. Source code is in the `Source/LocoBuddy` directory, with each type in a separate file.
